## Reflection

This was a project that I built in order to help myself learn React and SCSS. Project goals included familiarizing myself with the basics of React and SCSS such as, Props and Hooks in React, and variables and nesting in SCSS.

I set out to build an application that allows users to view the state of Mars.
